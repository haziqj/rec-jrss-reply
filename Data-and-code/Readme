Title: Random Projection Ensemble Classification

Authors: Timothy I. Cannings and Richard J. Samworth

Description:

Settings.txt contains the simulation settings used in
Section 6.1 of the main paper and Section 4 of the supplementary
material.

Simulation_Code.R contains the R code for the simulations in Section
6.1 of the main paper and Section 4 in the supplementary material.
The code makes use of our R package RPEnsemble (available from CRAN).
The user needs to input the required jobs after '##Specify which jobs
in settings to run'.  The code will save an .Rdata file containing the
error estimates for each run of the experiment in the rows (denoted
$\hat{R}_l$ in the main text).  Each of the the columns is for a
different method, depending on which jobs are chosen.  The risk
estimates and standard errors in the main text can then be calculated
as described in Section 6.1.
